This repository is for adding new systems to the Knulli linux retro gaming build.  Knulli is based on Batocera and is oriented to handheld portable gaming devices.

Some like to break out the various consoles into smaller specific systems.  For example, the NES is also known as Famicom.  While they shared most of the same games there were some Famicom exclusives that the NES didnâ€™t get.  This is the same for other consoles that also had releases in Japan.

By breaking them out into individual consoles, this allows more customization to the EmulationStation menu and game browsing.

Most themes are setup to support the majority of these new systems however some may need to be added.

The following systems are added (or updated) via this repository.
